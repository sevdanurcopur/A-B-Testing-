# A-B-Testing-

A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a statistical experimental design where two or more different versions are compared with each other. Essentially, A/B testing aims to determine which version is more effective by comparing the performance of different variations before and after a change is made.

A/B testing is an important tool for companies looking to make data-driven and systematic decisions. By directly observing the effects of changes, A/B testing allows for data-driven decision-making and can help optimize business strategies.
